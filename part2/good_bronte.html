				<h1>About Me</h1>
			</header>
		    <p>I am currently an undergraduate student at the Univeristy of Alberta, aiming to finish by Spring 2015. My first year of Univeristy was with the Science 100 program where I was first exposed to programming. This caught my interest more than the other Sciences (though Psychology and Earth and Atmospheric Sciences was close) and now here I am.</p>
            <p>
            I've recently taken interested in 3D graphics and animation, as the creation of graphic reminds me of sculpting, a form of non-digital art I had enjoyed. I also enjoy camping and rock climbing.</p>

			<h2>Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Tangible Computing I & II</h2>
            <h3>September 2012 - ongoing</h3>
			<p>Previously known as CMPUT 296/CMPUT 297. This course is now required for students in the Honours program for Computing Science, and software engineers. The course is taught in (Arduino) C and Python. Responsibilities include marking, hosting office hours, helping with course changes/adaptations.</p>

            <h2>CMPUT 101 Revamp</h2>
            <h3>May 2013 - June 2013</h3>
            <p>Experimented and designed labs in Python and Processing for CMPUT 101 to replace the second language they taught, PET.</p>

            <h2>CMPUT 301 Intro to Software Engineering Group Project</h2>
            <h3>September 2012 - December 2012</h3>
            <p>A group project aimed to develop an Android application in a team of five people. We went through the basic sofware designing process while working on the application. We worked on a Task sharing application where a user could post tasks for other Android users to see and fulfill.</p>

            <h2>CMPUT 296/CMPUT 297 Introductory Lab Revamp</h2>
            <h3>May 2012 - June 2012</h3>
            <p>Helped reorganize and clean up the four introductory labs. This included refactoring Arduino code, using mainly the C aspects rather than C++ parts, taking clearer photos of wired up Arduinos, making Fritzing diagrams to help with the wiring of Arduinos.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Some programming languages: C, Python, Java, Common Lisp, Prolog, Android, Arduino, Processing, Javascript, HTML/HTML5, CSS</li>
        <li>Spoken languages: English, a bit of Japanese, some Spanish, some Biblical Hebrew. Want to learn some German next.</li>
        <li>Loves writing/drawing/planning on paper/whiteboards before working away. Planning is important to me. And so is documentation, so I know what happened.</li>
        <li>Can work alone or in groups, though I prefer to have a mix of both.</li>
