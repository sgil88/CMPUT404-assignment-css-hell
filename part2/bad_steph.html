			<p> I am currently a 4th year undergraduate computing science student at the University of Alberta hoping to graduate in the spring of

			and am quite interested in linguistics, digital audio, and web development. In my spare time, I really enjoy writing and playing music, 
			learning foreign languages, teaching beginner Spanish, and watching British television.
