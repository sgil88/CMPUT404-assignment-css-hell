Collaboration  
=============  

Pair programmed:  
Bronte Lee and Stephanie Gil  

Changes Made For Part 1  
=======================  
- added a fixed background image
- changed font color and header color  
- added borders to images  
- changed padding + margin of paragraphs, headers, body  
- changed text decoration for link so they don't look like normal blue links  
  with the underlining, and when you hover over them, they change color.  
- changed the formatting of table contents that were too  long  
- centered the pres and the headers  
- made the horizontal lines slightly transparent so they weren't so in your   
 face, and we changed their width  
- made the line-height of paragraphs larger (so 1.5 spacing), and changed   
  the font size to be bigger and easier to read. 
- got rid of terrible background of sections that linked to an alternative  
  html version
- commented out original css in the head of the original html files
